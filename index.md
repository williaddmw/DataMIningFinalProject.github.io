The aim of our project is to use machine learning methods and an electronic survey to develop a clinical support system to diagnose whether a patient has BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) or not. We have employed decision tree and ANN model to generate features and predict outcomes using Weka based on survey result. Our contribution for this class will be using more machine learning models such as random forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines in Python to compare decision trees and ANN models. With decision trees and ANN model, our accuracy rate in diagnosis is around 70%, we may be able to check if the accuracy would be improved with new models or the accuracy rate that we obtained has reached a threshold considering there could be certain noise in the data set. Additional literary analysis will examine similar research to further understanding of potential methods to incorporate and deepen project understanding.
BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) is a common dizziness disease with very high misdiagnosis rate. Our goal is to improve the health care by obtaining a minimum set of questions that can achieve around 90% accuracy diagnosis rate. Earlier research conducted has identified features that can be used to predicted BPPV diagnosis [1]. Our project work is built on the framework of early two-phase survey conducted to diagnose BBPV using decision tree [2]. Two iterations of survey and data analysis have been conducted and our project is moving to the phase three and four of our research. We will have approximately 280 patient surveys with diagnosis result in the end. The project involves archiving and collecting data and training machine learning models using WEKA (a data mining tool) and Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda distribution for the diagnosis of BPPV disease. In terms of phase three survey, we recently have collected many new patient data with diagnosis results. Thus, the project plan is to combine patient data already collected in phase one, two and three with new data coming. For phase three, we currently have analyzed 72 patient data. And we expect to have about 90 patients in total in phase three, and we will do incremental analysis with about 10 patient record intervals. Our project will continue to explore a novel ensemble approach to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for BPPV. This method will generate multiple trees using training data and make predication based on majority vote or weighted decision. Therefore, a group of trees instead of individual tress will be combined to predict BPPV disease. The project will also employee artificial neural network to predict BBPV. In addition, our research would deliver a phase 4 survey application using Android studio which includes a supplemental section. The supplemental section will include most-updated decision trees results generated from combined dataset from phase 1, 2 and 3. Our project may also refine questions in phase 4 to get more accurate responses from patients. Another goal of my project section is to implement a learning system through which the survey can be updated periodically. In the end, we want to improve health care situation by achieving a survey template that provide a minimum number of questions to predict BPPV disease. We expected the model to have high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in our prediction with the help of machine learning algorithms. And our survey model will deliver an android tablet application
to be used in clinical support system. Our data set is collected by study coordinators from Medical College of Wisconsin first through Android Tablets and diagnosis results by doctors are emailed to us separately later.
